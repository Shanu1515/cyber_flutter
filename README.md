<h3 align="center">Introducing a new set of Flutter widgets called Cyber Widget</h3>

<a href="https://sbis04.github.io/cyber_flutter/"><h3 align="center">Test it on Flutter Web</h3></a>

The design of these components are inspired from the UI designs created by **[Chris Kieffer](https://twitter.com/ChrisKEE4)** (UI designer for multiple well known movies like **Intersteller**, **Passengers** and also a really popular TV series known as **Westworld**).

**Cyber Widgets** are the recreated versions of the basic Flutter components, but with a nice *futuristic-look*. It consists of the following components:

* CyberScaffold
* CyberBar
* CyberText
* CyberButton
* CyberContainer
* CyberTextField
* CyberDialogBox
* work is going on to include more components ...

**CustomPaint** widget is the main tool that I have used for creating these designs.

The components are still not prefect and work is going on to improve them. This will be available in a package format on **pub.dev** soon.

## Cyber Components

The components are customizable and are created to react similar to the **non-Cyber** version of these widgets in the Widget Tree.
